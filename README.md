# parket-project

## Requirements

Connect to the API and retrieve the buildings that I own and their relevant parking bays.

## Build Setup

Before starting the project create a .env file with your username and password. An example file has been provided in the root folder.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
```
